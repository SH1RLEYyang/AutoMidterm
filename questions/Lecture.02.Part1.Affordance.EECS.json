    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of affordance as defined by James J. Gibson and provide an example of affordance in an everyday object.",
      "answer": "James J. Gibson defines affordance as the opportunities for action that objects in the environment provide to an animal. It refers to the mutual relationship between the environment and the animal. For example, a chair affords sitting; its design and structure invite this specific action."
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the Visual Cliff Experiment and its significance in understanding affordance perception in infants.",
      "answer": "The Visual Cliff Experiment involves a glass table with a patterned surface beneath that creates an illusion of a cliff. Infants placed on the edge of the 'cliff' typically refuse to crawl over it despite encouragement, suggesting that they perceive depth and understand its implications for action, demonstrating an early form of affordance perception."
    },
    {
      "question": "Differentiate between object affordance and scene affordance with suitable examples.",
      "answer": "Object affordance refers to the potential interactions with individual objects based on their properties, such as a cup affording drinking. Scene affordance considers the potential interactions within a whole environment, considering spatial relationships and multi-object interactions, such as a kitchen affording cooking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Discuss the role of mirror neurons in understanding affordance.",
      "answer": "Mirror neurons activate both when an individual performs an action and when they observe the same action performed by others. This suggests that perception of objects is linked to potential actions, as observing a hammer may activate neurons associated with its use, simulating the afforded actions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between affordance and functionality? Provide an example illustrating this difference.",
      "answer": "Affordance refers to the possibilities for action that an object provides to a user, while functionality pertains to the tasks that the object is designed to perform. For example, a spoon affords scooping (affordance) but its functionality is to aid in eating (functionality)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain how the concept of affordance can be utilized in computational models for robotics.",
      "answer": "In computational models for robotics, affordance can be used to predict possible interactions between a robot and its environment. This involves understanding object properties and scene contexts to determine how a robot can interact with its surroundings, such as identifying which objects can be grasped or which surfaces afford navigation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of social affordance differ from physical affordance? Give an example of social affordance.",
      "answer": "Social affordance pertains to the possibilities for social interactions an object or scene offers, often based on cultural or social norms, whereas physical affordance is related to tangible actions. For example, a chair affords sitting (physical), but in a social context, sitting on a throne may afford authority or status (social)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Discuss the challenges of affordance detection in computer vision tasks.",
      "answer": "Affordance detection in computer vision involves identifying and labeling the actions that objects afford, rather than merely classifying objects. Challenges include dealing with the variability of object appearances, context-dependent affordances, and integrating multiple sensory inputs to accurately predict possible interactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of Gibson's theory of affordances in moving beyond traditional object classification in computer vision?",
      "answer": "Gibson's theory of affordances emphasizes understanding the potential interactions between agents and their environments, rather than just classifying objects. This approach helps in building models that predict actions and interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of scenes and objects in dynamic contexts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can understanding affordances improve human-robot interaction in practical applications?",
      "answer": "Understanding affordances can enhance human-robot interaction by allowing robots to anticipate and respond to human needs and actions more effectively. For instance, a robot recognizing that a door handle affords opening can assist in navigation tasks, while understanding seating affordances can help in arranging spaces for optimal human comfort and accessibility."
