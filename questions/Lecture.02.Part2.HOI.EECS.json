    {
      "question": "Define affordance and functionality, and explain their roles in Human-Object Interaction (HOI).",
      "answer": "Affordance refers to the potential actions that objects suggest or allow based on their properties, such as shape and size. Functionality is the intended purpose or use of an object. In HOI, affordance helps in identifying possible interactions a human can have with an object, while functionality guides the intended use of the object within the context of human activities."

    {
      "question": "Explain how 2D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is formulated using bounding boxes and labels.",
      "answer": "2D HOI detection involves identifying humans and objects in an image using 2D bounding boxes. With labels, each detected box is assigned a category like 'human' or 'object'. The detection process requires analyzing the spatial arrangement and relationships between these boxes to infer interactions between humans and objects."

    {
      "question": "Describe the process of reconstructing a 3D scene from 2D HOI data.",
      "answer": "Reconstructing a 3D scene from 2D HOI data involves using 2D image data to infer the depth and spatial relationships of objects and humans within a scene. The process often employs techniques like depth estimation and pose recognition, which leverage prior knowledge of object shapes and human anatomy to convert 2D representations into a comprehensive 3D model."

    {
      "question": "Compare the voxel grid and point cloud methods for 3D representation in terms of their structure and application.",
      "answer": "A voxel grid is a regular 3D grid layout that offers clear spatial relationships and simple indexing, making it suitable for applications like volume rendering and collision detection. However, it is memory-intensive due to its dense structure. In contrast, a point cloud is a memory-efficient set of 3D points with flexible point density, ideal for applications like LiDAR scanning and 3D object detection. It captures fine details but lacks fixed neighborhood relationships, complicating feature extraction."

    {
      "question": "What are the key components of the SMPL model for human body representation?",
      "answer": "The SMPL model includes components such as a skeleton with joint locations, body pose parameters, and a skin mesh. It uses Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to map the skeleton's movement to the skin, allowing for expressive and realistic modeling of human body shapes and poses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does scene affordance differ from object affordance, and what role does it play in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI)?",
      "answer": "Scene affordance refers to the potential interactions within an environment based on the combination and arrangement of multiple objects, as opposed to object affordance, which focuses on individual objects. In HSI, scene affordance guides the possible human activities that can be performed within a context, influencing how scenes are designed and interacted with."

    {
      "question": "Outline the process of motion generation using an autoregressive diffusion model in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI).",
      "answer": "In HSI, motion generation using an autoregressive diffusion model involves using a sequence of small, iterative steps to generate human motion patterns. This process ensures continuity between motion segments by connecting them seamlessly, allowing for the generation of complex, interactive motion sequences based on learned scene constraints."

    {
      "question": "Discuss the advantages and challenges of using Signed-Distance Field (SDF) for 3D object representation.",
      "answer": "SDF offers a continuous and differentiable representation of 3D objects, making it suitable for handling complex topologies and enabling gradient-based optimization. However, it presents challenges such as the need for dense sampling and high computational overhead during queries, which can limit its real-time performance and integration with traditional graphics pipelines."

    {
      "question": "Explain how generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, contribute to 3D scene generation.",
      "answer": "Generative AI methods like diffusion models contribute to 3D scene generation by learning data distributions to create new content. These models gradually transform simple distributions into complex ones through iterative noise addition and removal, allowing for the synthesis of realistic and varied 3D environments from minimal initial information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of human cues in human-centric scene synthesis, and how do they influence scene design?",
      "answer": "Human cues, such as typical human postures and activities, serve as constraints in human-centric scene synthesis. They guide the arrangement of objects and spaces to ensure that scenes are functional and supportive of human actions. This influence is crucial in creating environments that are not only visually appealing but also practical for human interaction and activity."
