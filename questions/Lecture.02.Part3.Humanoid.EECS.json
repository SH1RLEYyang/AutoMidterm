      "question": "Explain the difference between 'soft constraints' in video generation and 'hard constraints' in robotics generation.",
      "answer": "In video generation, 'soft constraints' refer to the flexibility in achieving visual plausibility and semantic coherence, where errors can be artistic or glitchy, such as a cat with five legs. Physics is a suggestion rather than a strict rule. In contrast, robotics generation involves 'hard constraints,' where the laws of physics are non-negotiable. The vast majority of possible robot actions result in fatal errors, as robots must adhere strictly to physical laws like gravity, balance, and obstacle avoidance."

      "question": "What is the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and its limitations in humanoid robotics?",
      "answer": "The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is a concept in humanoid robotics for maintaining balance, where it represents the point on the ground where the total of the reaction forces due to gravity and inertia is zero. The ZMP must remain within the support polygon to ensure stability. However, ZMP is limited because it cannot be applied if the foot slips, the ground is uneven, or there are external force inputs."

      "question": "Describe the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) and its assumptions in humanoid robot locomotion.",
      "answer": "The Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) is a simplified model for humanoid robot locomotion that assumes the center of mass (CoM) remains at a constant height, the legs are massless, and there is no change in angular momentum. This model helps predict and control the horizontal motion of the CoM to maintain balance and decide foot placement during walking."

    {
      "question": "How does reinforcement learning contribute to humanoid robot control, and what are its limitations?",
      "answer": "Reinforcement learning (RL) enables humanoid robots to learn dynamic motor skills by rewarding desired actions, allowing robots to adapt to complex environments. However, RL-based methods require complex, manually-designed rewards to perform human-like behavior, and without sophisticated reward design, robots may achieve tasks in unnatural ways."

    {
      "question": "What is the sim-to-real gap, and what causes it in humanoid robotics?",
      "answer": "The sim-to-real gap refers to the discrepancies between simulations and real-world performance in humanoid robotics. This gap is caused by differences in physical parameters, such as terrain, mass, and friction, as well as assumptions of idealized physics in simulations that do not account for real-world complexities like motor errors and noisy observations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is motion retargeting in humanoid robotics, and why is it challenging?",
      "answer": "Motion retargeting in humanoid robotics involves adapting human motion data to humanoid robots, which is challenging due to the differences in skeleton structures and degrees of freedom. Retargeting aims to replicate human motion on robots, but requires complex algorithms to map and adjust joint movements accurately, often involving inverse kinematics and optimization techniques."

    {
      "question": "Discuss the role of imitation learning in humanoid robotics and its challenges.",
      "answer": "Imitation learning in humanoid robotics involves training robots to mimic human movements by using expert demonstrations from data sources like 3D MoCap. The challenge lies in the limited availability of diverse and comprehensive human motion data, as well as the need to translate these movements to robots with different physical constraints and capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of 'orbital energy' in the context of LIPM for humanoid robots.",
      "answer": "Orbital energy (OE) in the context of LIPM refers to a type of virtual potential energy that reflects the motion state of the robot's center of mass (CoM). It remains conserved during the motion process, allowing for adjustments in foot placement to maintain balance. Positive OE indicates the CoM can pass the balance point, while negative OE suggests a step backward is needed."

    {
      "question": "What are the key factors affecting humanoid robot performance, and how should they be evaluated?",
      "answer": "Humanoid robot performance is influenced by factors such as robot ontology (hardware reliability and mechanical design), control algorithms, and engineering capability. Evaluating performance requires considering these factors holistically, rather than judging based on demonstration performance alone. The interplay between excellent hardware, algorithms, and engineering effort determines overall effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process and significance of sim-to-real transfer in humanoid robotics.",
      "answer": "Sim-to-real transfer involves adapting models trained in simulation to perform effectively in the real world. This process is significant as it addresses the sim-to-real gap by incorporating techniques like system identification, dynamics randomization, and fine-tuning with delta action models. Successful sim-to-real transfer enhances the robot's ability to execute tasks reliably in real-world environments."
